                            As a therapist who practices emotion-focused therapy, I often bring attention to the hear-and-now about your feelings    and thoughts and provide a safe space for you to express, understand, and process those feelings.

                    <ul>

                        <li>
                          We will examine the dynamics of your upbringing and highlight any maladaptive patterns that influence your current decisions. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When we meet for the first time, you will have a free 30-minute consultation via video or phone call to determine if we are a good fit
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I will ask your reason for seeking a therapist, any previous treatment youâ€™ve had, goals for therapy, and answer any questions you may have for me.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    If you choose to continue working with me, we will start the intake process. In this session, I like to gain background information. By that I mean your upbringing, relational dynamics with your parents, siblings, etc. If you choose to continue with me, we will meet weekly for 45 minutes. My role is to be an objective observer who emotionally supports and sensitively challenges you through your journey and, for those reasons, I look forward to working with you.
