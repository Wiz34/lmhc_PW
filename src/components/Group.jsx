                As a group therapist, I will act as an observer to highlight and help facilitate emotional understanding within each member when interacting with other people.

                <ul>
                    <li>

                        The goal is to help achieve authenticity between each member and the collective group. Groups are 10 to 12 members who struggle with anxiety, depression, highly defendedness, etc.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before the group is formed, members are interviewed individually by me to see if they are a good fit for the group. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Within the group setting, members will share their goals and expectations. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If I determine the group dynamic is a right fit for all, we will meet weekly for 90 minutes. 
                    </li>

                </ul>
