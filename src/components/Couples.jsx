                As an emotion-focused couples therapist, I pay attention to emotional communication styles that you bring to one another. My role is to highlight and help navigate through unproductive behavioral patterns to more productive emotional communication.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each weekly session will be one hour long.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                     We still start our sessions with me learning your relationship. By that I mean I will observe your communication and behavioral styles towards one another while asking questions about your relational dynamics.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In our next two sessions, I will interview each member individually to understand relational dynamics within your personal upbringings, families of origin, values, and cultural backgrounds. 
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        In session four, we will meet jointly again and I will share my observations and assessments for treatment, and outline suggestions to help implement your goals in therapy.
