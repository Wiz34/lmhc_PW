                Wondering if therapy is for you? That is a question often asked. Although therapy can lead to great insight and self-discoveries, it is still not for everyone.
                
                So why choose therapy? 

                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Some people choose therapy because they struggle with internal conflict and feel helpless with managing those conflicts in a healthy way.   
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Some choose therapy because they struggle with finding objective people to talk to about their inner thoughts and concerns that leave them feeling lonely and isolated.  
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Some choose therapy because they have concerned friends and loved ones who suggest therapy as a way for that person to connect better with them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                      People choose therapy for many reasons and yours could be very different. As a result, it is common to ask about therapy. If you have questions, please feel free to contact me on my contact page (link to contact page).
