        About ME
      </h1>
        
          <p>  I am a mental health therapist. I have 10+ years experience servicing a diverse group of clients with varying needs in the academic, clinical, and residential settings. I have worked with multiple case-loads utilizing various tools to treat clients ranging from Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, Anxiety Disorders, Trauma-Related Disorders, Borderline Personality Disorders, and the learning disabled. I have demonstrated success providing career, individual, and group counseling and therapeutic crisis intervention for individuals ranging from young to older adults. I have developed and led support groups, presentations, events, and relationship and career workshops for colleagues and clients by incorporating psychological challenges, goals, behavioral analyses, self-reflection, and active listening activities within each task. Outside of clinical work, I enjoy roller skating, eating out, working out, socializing, and alone time. It would be my pleasure to work with you on your journey and help you achieve your goals.
