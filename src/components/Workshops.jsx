                As a workshop facilitator, I have organized and developed workshops that cater to the needs of the members within the group. 

                <ul>
                    <li>
                     Within the workshop, interested members met on a weekly basis for a predetermined number of weeks. 

                    </li>
                    <li>
                    During our meetings, activities consisted of group processing, topic-based discussions, self-reflection exercises, and emotionally challenging activities for development. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    

                Examples of past workshops: Unhealthy Temptations: How to Avoid Toxic Relationships; and Fearful to Freedom: How to Create Your Career and Change Your Passion. If interested, please contact me (link to contact page) and we can discuss your needs and desired goals.
